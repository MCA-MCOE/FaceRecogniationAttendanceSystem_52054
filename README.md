# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Project Overview

The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a modern and efficient solution for automating the attendance process using facial recognition technology. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, this system is designed to identify and register students' attendance in a classroom setting. The system aims to eliminate the need for manual attendance taking and reduces human error, providing a seamless and accurate method of recording attendance.

This project was developed as part of the **MCA-MCOE** (Master of Computer Applications - MCOE) course and is intended for use in educational institutions to help automate the process of attendance management.

## Features

- **Automatic Face Recognition**: The system uses a camera to capture the face of the student and matches it with pre-registered images for attendance tracking.
- **Real-Time Attendance Recording**: The system updates the attendance sheet in real-time as students' faces are recognized.
- **Database Integration**: Student attendance records are stored in a SQLite database (`attendance.db`) for easy management and retrieval.
- **CSV Export**: Attendance data can be exported into a `.csv` file for reporting and further analysis.
- **Web Interface**: The system provides a simple web interface to view and manage attendance data.
- **Easy Enrollment**: Students can enroll by uploading their face images for recognition, which are saved and used for future attendance sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Face Recognition**: OpenCV and `face_recognition` library.
- **Web Framework**: Flask for creating a simple web application (`app.py`).
- **Database**: SQLite for storing attendance records (`attendance.db`).
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `face_recognition`: for facial recognition and processing.
  - `pandas`: for handling CSV file export.
  - `opencv-python`: for real-time video capture and face detection.
  - `Flask`: for web interface and backend functionality.

## Project Files

- **`app.py`**: Main file that runs the Flask web application and manages attendance data.
- **`atten.py`**: Handles the facial recognition process and links it to attendance marking.
- **`attendance.csv`**: A CSV file for exporting and viewing attendance data.
- **`attendance.db`**: SQLite database for storing and managing attendance records.
- **`faces/`**: Folder containing images of students for facial recognition enrollment.
